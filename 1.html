				<h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
				<p><strong>My name is Sunil Giri and I grew up in the streets of Radhapur with my family of six. Life was simple. The vast fields bore witness to our curiosity, and as kids,  We often took to the expansive backyard for our adventures. As I got older I realized nothing ever goes as planned in this world.</strong></p><br>
				<p><em>Iâ€™m a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. ðŸ˜‹</em></p>
